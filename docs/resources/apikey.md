## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name for the API key.
- `expiry_time` (String) The expiry time for the API key in ISO 8601 format.
- `owner_id` (String) The ID of the owner to create the API key for.
- `owner_type` (String) The type of the owner to create the API key.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description for the API key.
- `disabled` (Boolean) Whether the API key is disabled.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the API key.
- `state` (String) The current state of the API key.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# API Keys can be imported to incorporate existing API Keys into your Terraform pipeline. 
# To import an API Key, you need
# - a resource configuration in your Terraform configuration file/module to accept the imported API Key. In the example below, the placeholder is "temporalcloud_apikey" "tfapikey"
# - the API Key's ID, which is found when clicking into an API Key in the Temporal Cloud UI. In the example below, this is zJV5zQ3IhsAbw75dAkVNEMsAd3a5AemC

terraform import temporalcloud_apikey.tfapikey zJV5zQ3IhsAbw75dAkVNEMsAd3a5AemC
```

# temporalcloud_connectivity_rule (Resource)

Provisions a Temporal Cloud Connectivity Rule.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Create Public Connectivity Rule
resource "temporalcloud_connectivity_rule" "public_rule" {
  connectivity_type = "public"
}

// Create Private Connectivity Rule for AWS
resource "temporalcloud_connectivity_rule" "private_aws" {
  connectivity_type = "private"
  connection_id     = "vpce-12345678"
  region            = "aws-us-west-2"
}

resource "temporalcloud_namespace" "terraform-ns" {
  name               = "terraform4"
  regions            = ["aws-us-west-2"]
  api_key_auth       = true
  retention_days     = 7
  // Enable access via internet and over the PrivateLink
  connectivity_rule_ids = [
    private_aws.id, public_rule.id
  ]
}
```

GCP PSC rule creation:

```terraform
// Create Private Connectivity Rule for GCP
resource "temporalcloud_connectivity_rule" "private_gcp" {
  connectivity_type = "private"
  connection_id     = "vpce-12345678"
  region            = "gcp-us-central1"
  gcp_project_id    = "my-gcp-project-id"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connectivity_type` (String) The type of connectivity. Must be one of 'public' or 'private'.

### Optional

- `connection_id` (String) The connection ID of the private connection.
- `gcp_project_id` (String) The GCP project ID. Required when cloud_provider is 'gcp'.
- `region` (String) The region of the connection. Example: 'aws-us-west-2'.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the Connectivity Rule.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
